== Axway AMPLIFY Streams Java SDK


=== What does the API do?

It connects to the server with some your API URL and your credentials (API key) and you get notified using either

* Some callback you provide
* Through an RxJava2 `Flowable`

You can choose to receive snapshots only or one snapshot and then patches you don't even know SSE is used, you just use your data.

=== Step by step setup to run demo

* Create an free account on Axway AMPLIFY Streams https://portal.streamdata.io/#/register to get an App token.
* Clone project, edit Main.java and replace [YOUR TOKEN HERE] with your App token.
* Make sure you have Java 8+ installed
* Make sure you have maven 3.0+ installed
* Build project with maven:

    `mvn clean install`

* Run sample from a terminal:

    `java -jar target/streamdataio-java-sdk-1.0.jar`

* You should see data and patches pushed in your application and displayed on your terminal.
* You can build the jar on your own and use provided classes to use this API.
You can use the provided demo which stream an API of factice financial market: 'http://stockmarket.streamdata.io/v2/prices'

Feel free to test it with any REST/Json API of your choice. You can add authorization headers and query params.


=== How to integrate the API into your project

*Maven*

_after building this project_

[xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.streamdata</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

*Gradle*

----
dependencies {
    compile("io.streamdata:java-sdk:1.0")
}
----

Notable transitive dependencies :

* Glassfish Jersey as EventSource client (https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/sse.html)
* RxJava 2 (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* Jackson for Json processing  (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome).
* zjsonpatch (https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/zjsonpatch) as a Java Json-Patch implementation
* Slf4j with a default configuration

=== Callback based API

This API is based on callbacks and is very similar to our Node.js API.

[java]
----

String apiURL = "http://api.mycompany.com/prices";
String appKey = "YOUR OWN APP KEY";                                             # <1>

EventSourceClient client = StreamdataClient.createClient(apiURL, appKey);
client.addHeader("X-MYAPI-POLLER", "Polled By SD.io")                           # <2>
        .useJsonPatch(true)                                                     # <3>
        .onSnapshot(this::processData)                                          # <4>
        .onPatch(patch -> this.processPatch(patch, client.getCurrentSnaphot())) # <5>
        .onOpen(() -> logger.info("And we are... live!"))                       # <6>
        .onClose(() -> logger.info("And we are... dead!"))                      # <7>
        .onError(err -> logger.error("An error occured {}", err))               # <8>
        .onException(ex -> logger.error("Unexpected error", ex))                # <9>
        .open();                                                                # <10>
----

<1> This the key you when you created your app in the web portal.
<2> Headers to be added when polling your API (Typically some auth header) [_Optional_ ]
<3> This allows you let streamdata send snapshots only (set `false` to do so) or snapshot then patch (default behaviour if you don't call this method) [_Optional_ ]
<4> A callback that will consume the snapshot
<5> A callback that will consume the patch (you can access the snaphost anyways) [_Optional_ ]
<6> Called when successfully open the connection [_Optional_ ]
<7> Called the connection is actually closed [_Optional_ ]
<6> Called when the stream return an error, by default the error is logged. Usually it is recommended to close the connection: ```client.close()``` [_Optional_ ]
<7> Call when an error occurs, mainly when opening the event source, by default the error is logged but it is recommended to close the connection: ```client.close()``` [_Optional_ ]
<10> Open the connection with the server and start streamdata.


=== RxJava based API

This API relies on the previous one but expose a rx's Flowable interface to handle data coming from the server.
Data is wrapped in a simple Event class allowing you to know is the data is an error a patch or a snapshot.


[java]
----

String apiURL = "http://api.mycompany.com/prices";
String appKey = "YOUR OWN APP KEY";                                             # <1>


StreamdataClient.createRxJavaClient(apiURL, appKey)
            .addHeader("X-MYAPI-POLLER", "Polled By SD.io")                     # <2>
            .useJsonPatch(true)                                                 # <3>
            .toFlowable()                                                       # <4>
            // here you can add operator to manipulate the flow
            .subscribe(event -> {                                               # <5>
                if (event.isSnapshot()) {
                    this.processData(event.getSnapshot())
                } else if (event.isPatch()) {
                    this.processData(event.getPatch(), event.getSnapshot())
                } else if (event.isError()) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(event.getError().toString());    # <6>
                }
            }, err -> logger.error(err.getMessage(), err));

----
<1> Same as above
<2> Same as above
<3> Same as above
<4> Once configured you can start manipulating you data or use specific schedulers 
<5> An example without using any rx operators before show you available methods on event
<6> Shis will stop the flowable and disconnect the event source

== Errors

Errors not a simple string. It is JSON!

Above, an example of an error so you can get more detailed informations.

[JSON]
```
{
    "status":2005,
    "cause":"An error occurred while streaming http://stockmarket.streamdata.io/priceshttp://stockmarket.streamdata.io/prices. : HTTP/1.1 404 ",
    "message":"HTTP error. The Http response cannot be processed.",
    "timestamp":1512566770744,
    "sessionId":"62fd67bc-d090-4333-a783-d94b366f55f4"
